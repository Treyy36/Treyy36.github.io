        My Dearest Harper (aka soon to be super hot wifey), <br> <br>

        I am literally so excited for you to be my wife! You cannot even imagine. I am just so thankful as I write this,
        thinking about you. And praising the Lord for all the blessing he is giving me. Not only am I marrying into one of the
        sweetest families and extended families I have ever met.. (like seriously i love them all so much) but I am also literally marrying the most beautiful, strong,
        and intelligent woman I have ever met. And that excites me beyond all else! I cannot wait to start living life with you to  
        the fullest everyday! <br> <br>

        I don't know what all is yet to come, but I am so joyful knowing I get to do it with you! I cant say it enough. Nothing has made me
        more excited than thinking about how I will get to fully love you, know you, cherish you, and honor you for the rest of my life.
        I am so thankful that Jesus has allowed me to be your husband, and has given me the capacity to love a women as amazing as you.
        <br><br>

        I love how not only has Jesus commanded me to do this because it is good for you, but he has done it because it is good for me.
        I can truly say that I enjoy every second I get to serve and love you. Like for real I can almost do it selfishly. (Okay.. maybe I am a 
        have a slight bias because sometimes it leads to extra snuggles hehe). But it all honestly I am so passionate about you, my bride, and I
        hope I can continue to convince you of this as we get to live the rest of our lives 
        together, and I get the honor of sacrificing and serving you each and everyday.
        <br><br>
         
        In the small things like brining you coffee and breakfast in bed, or brightening up your our house with
        fresh lilies and tulips, or the big things like moving with you to Tennessee or anywhere else that allows you to pursue your 
        dreams, It will be a joy to do it with you. Because your my bestest friend..
        <br><br>

        And I will love you forever, because I am yours.. and you.. are mine.
        <br><br>
        Love your bestest friend, and soon to be husband.. <br>
        Trey :)
